Things to do.


Print Preview opens at 75% as it should.
Ideally, 75% would be selected upon opening. It is not, but not a big deal.
Also,  zoom selection doesnt forget setting when closing preview (if opened a 2nd time, previous setting selected).
Working on it..
Radio buttons sometimes dont cooperate :)


Line/column number only binds to return key. 
Haven't worked on this too much, it could use improvement. 
Like arrow keys, mouse bindings.


To be continued..
