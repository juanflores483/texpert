**Requirements:**  

Texpert was desgined with linux for use on linux but can be made to work on other operating systems.  

Macs: Should be no problem as long as OS X is installed (since OS X is Unix based).

Windows: Texpert will need to be turned into an executable using PyInstaller or similiar program.  
Python 2 or 3 will also need to be installed (from within Windows).  

Program uses systems default color schemes, so will look different on each OS.  
If problems occur, or a black hole forms, please let me know.
