Things to do.


Would like to include overwrite feature to edit menu, 
but dont know if that can be done using tkinter, cant find any info, anywhere. 



Line/column number only binds to return key. 
Haven't worked on this too much, it could use improvement. 
Like arrow keys, mouse bindings.



To be continued..
